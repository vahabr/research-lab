## 🚀 How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vahabr/research-lab.git
   cd research-lab
````

2. Navigate to the project folder, e.g.:

   ```bash
   cd lifetime-PD-AKF/code
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run simulations / notebooks:

   ```bash
   python run_experiments.py
   ```

Each project has its own **README.md** inside with detailed instructions.
